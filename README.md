Did see that before? So you need a Device Support files in order the Xcode would "speak" with your device.  
You can download them here an paste into  
`/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport` folder 

To fast navigation go to Finder, press `CMD`+`Shift`+`G` and paste the route.
